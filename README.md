## About CS50P

CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python is a free online course offered by Harvard University. It provides a hands-on introduction to programming using Python, one of the most versatile and widely-used programming languages. The course focuses on teaching fundamental programming concepts, problem-solving techniques, and how to write clean, efficient, and readable code.

Designed for both beginners and those with prior programming experience, CS50P serves as an excellent starting point for anyone looking to learn Python or expand their technical skill set.

## Why Problem Sets?

Problem sets are integral to CS50P, offering real-world challenges that require applying the programming concepts and techniques covered in lectures. These assignments help solidify understanding, encourage critical thinking, and foster the development of problem-solving skills.

---

## Through these practical examples:
 - Practice writing Python code in a structured and logical manner.
 - Learn to approach complex problems by breaking them into manageable parts.
 - Develop debugging skills and learn how to test and improve their programs.
 - Build a foundation for more advanced programming topics and projects.

>Each problem set is designed to gradually increase in complexity, ensuring a smooth progression from simple tasks to more challenging programming problems.

## Problem Set Descriptions

Here is an overview of each problem set in the course:

### Problem Set 0: Functions, Variables

Introduces the basics of Python syntax, including functions, variables, and how to write simple programs.

You can see more about problems in [here](problem_set_0/README.md)

### Problem Set 1: Conditionals

Focuses on control flow using conditional statements to make decisions within programs.

You can see more about problems in [here](problem_set_1/README.md)

### Problem Set 2: Loops

Covers iteration using loops to perform repetitive tasks efficiently.

You can see more about problems in [here](problem_set_2/README.md)

### Problem Set 3: Exceptions

Teaches how to handle errors gracefully using exception handling mechanisms.

You can see more about problems in [here](problem_set_3/README.md)

### Problem Set 4: Libraries

Explores the use of Python’s standard libraries to extend the functionality of programs.

You can see more about problems in [here](problem_set_4/README.md)

### Problem Set 5: Unit Tests

Emphasizes the importance of testing code by writing unit tests to ensure program correctness.

You can see more about problems in [here](problem_set_5/README.md)

### Problem Set 6: File I/O

Deals with reading from and writing to files, enabling programs to persist data.

You can see more about problems in [here](problem_set_6/README.md)

### Problem Set 7: Regular Expressions

Introduces pattern matching and text manipulation using regular expressions.

You can see more about problems in [here](problem_set_7/README.md)

### Problem Set 8: Object-Oriented Programming

Covers the principles of object-oriented programming, including classes and objects.

## Setup and Run

1. Clone the repository:

        git clone https://github.com/michalpuskac/cs50-problem-sets.git

### Using a Virtual Environment
It's recmmended keep the project dependencies isolated:

**1. Create a virtual environment:**

	python -m venv venv
or
	python3 -m venv venv

**2. Activate the virtual environment:**

- On Windows:

        .\venv\Scripts\activate

- On macOS/Linux:

        source venv/bin/activate

**3. Install dependencies:**

	    pip install -r requirements.txt

**4.Navigate to separate problem set:**

        cd problem_set_<number of problem set>


**5. Run each script / application separatly:**

Each problem sets has own README.md. View more there.
