"""
Implement a function called convert that expects a str in any of the 12-hour formats 
below and returns the corresponding str in 24-hour format (i.e., 9:00 to 17:00). 
Expect that AM and PM will be capitalized (with no periods therein) 
and that there will be a space before each. Assume that these times are representative of actual times,
not necessarily 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM specifically.

9:00 AM to 5:00 PM
9 AM to 5 PM
9:00 AM to 5 PM
9 AM to 5:00 PM
Raise a ValueError instead if the input to convert is not in either of those formats or if either time is invalid (e.g., 12:60 AM, 13:00 PM, etc.). But do not assume that someoneâ€™s hours will start ante meridiem and end post meridiem; someone might work late and even long hours (e.g., 5:00 PM to 9:00 AM).
